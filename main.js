// EX 1
// 1. Input and Loops
// Create two variables called five assigned 5 and eight assigned 8. 
// Next create an if statement compairing five is less than eight. If it's true, , print “5 is less than 8”. Else, print ERROR in the console or browser.
// i will need two variables
//i will need an if statement with a true conditional
// i believe i can use a while loop here
//first we need to create two varibles with these names and values
// let five = 5;
// let eight = 8;
// //create an if statement comparing the two variables
// if (five < eight) { //If its true it will print the 1st option
//     console.log('5 is less than 8');
// } else { //if false it will print error
//     console.log(" ERROR . . Try Again ")
// }


// EX 2
// Print all even numbers from a user's given start and stop number in the console or browser.
//I belive i will need a function to gather the two start and stop points
//then we will need to put into an array
//then we will need to take out all the values that return as even using modulous
//then we will need print those to for loop
